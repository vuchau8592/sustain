			- This project is a basic classification that compares different classification models in term of 
			classification accuracy. In this project, the dataset contains 28 variables for 5043 movies, spanning 
			across 100 years in 66 countries. Their IMDB score will be divided in 2 groups: higher than 7 and 
			lower or equal to 7. Our classification models will try to classify the movie into those two groups.

			Here is the link of original dataset from dataworld: https://data.world/data-society/imdb-5000-movie-dataset

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">IMDB-rating-predict</a></strong>
			- Extension version of previous IMDB classification project. In this project, we will try to predict the
			IMDB score of movies with different regressors. Our expectation is that we can come up with a model that
			can achieve at least 70% accuracy when predicting.

			In this project, the dataset contains 28 variables for 5043 movies, spanning across 100 years in 66 countries.

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Movie-review-classification</a></strong>
			- Comparison of positive/negative movie review classification of several models

			In this project, we will try to predict whether the comments are negative or positive based on the dataset of 50,000 
			movie comments.

			The original dataset can be downloaded at: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="#">Stock-prediction</a></strong>
			- This is on-going project that tries to predict the price of stock market. Keras LSTM and Model will be used with 
			different technical indicators in order to make the prediction more timely and also remove the difference in level 
			of price.
